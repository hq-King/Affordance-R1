<think> To use the hammer effectively, it is important to hold it in a way that allows for control and leverage. The handle is the part that allows for gripping and applying force, while the head is the part that is used to strike objects. The handle is typically the part that one would hold to use the hammer. </think>

<rethink> The handle of the hammer is the part that allows for the most control and leverage when using the hammer. It is the part that one would typically hold to apply force and control the direction of the strike. The head of the hammer is the part that is used to strike objects, but it is not the part that one would typically hold to use the hammer. </rethink>
